  <h2>SAMOSA</h2>
  </font>
  <p>
  The Indian samosa is arguably the most recognizable and widely-available Indian food there is. 
  From street vendors to grocery stores to the menu in restaurants small and large, this delectable 
  morsel is practically synonymous with Indian cuisine. However, much like India itself, 
  the samosa has a surprisingly rich, diverse, and storied history, having traveled far and wide 
  through Central Asia and across the Himalayan Steppe to reach the place that in modern times 
  is thought of as its home.

  <h2>Chole Bhature</h2>
  </session>
  </font>
  <p>
  At its core, chole bhature is a combination of two dishes: chole - a spicy chickpea curry, 
  and bhature - a type of fried bread made with maida flour. Popular throughout North India, 
  the dish was invented in Delhi in the 1940s.
   It is commonly accompanied by onions, pickles, mint chutney, and chilled lassi. 
   Chole bhature can be found at most street carts in North India, but it can also be easily prepared at home.
   Although it can be eaten any time of the day, chole bhature is especially popular in the morning, 
  when bhature are filled with potatoes or cottage cheese, making it a heavy, nutritious breakfast.

  <h2>Pizza</h2>

  <p>
  The further back we look in time, the more interesting details we can find about that surrounds pizza.
 Today this dish is one of the most popular foods on the entire Earth, but that fame and recognition came 
 from the decades of work of many international pizza restaurant franchises which spread this dish to the all four
 corners of the world. Before these pizza chains were formed, this dish slowly rose in popularity in the United Stated, 
 brought from the Europe by the Italian settlers which did not wanted to be parted from one of the most iconic meals of 
 their country. 
 And there, in the Mediterranean coastal city of Naples, the modern Pizza was created.
